# Automated-Essay-Scoring-and-Recommendation-System
This repository consists of the code used in my research project for an Msc in Data Science. The project is based on works done in ‘Automated assessment of non-native learner essays: Investigating the role of linguistic features’ by Sowmya Vajjala (2016). The code includes following functions:
- Formatting of CLC-FCE dataset, based on work done by Gwenaelle Cunha Sergio (2019).
- Formatting of text scripts for discourse cohesion features, based on work done by Emily Pitler and Ani Nenkova (2009).
- 87 distinct Feature Extraction for training and test data, based on work done by Sowmya Vajjala (2016).
- Implementation of eight ML regression models for AES systems.
- Identifying top 10 best feature predictors.
- Performance of Ridge regression model for each feature group.
- Implementation of six Clustering algorithms for Recommendation systems.
